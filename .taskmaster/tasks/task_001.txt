# Task ID: 1
# Title: Complete Database Schema Implementation
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Finalize and optimize the Prisma database schema for all core entities including kits, users, reviews, and relationships
# Details:
The database schema is the foundation of the entire platform. Need to ensure all relationships are properly defined, indexes are optimized, and the schema supports all planned features from the PRD.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for all Prisma models, integration tests for complex relationships, performance tests for queries

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up testing framework and environment [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure Jest, Prisma test database, and testing utilities for database testing
### Details:
Install and configure Jest with TypeScript support, set up separate test database, configure Prisma test client, and create test utilities for database operations.

## 2. Create unit tests for all Prisma models [pending]
### Dependencies: ["1.1"]
### Description: Write comprehensive unit tests for CRUD operations on all models including User, Kit, Review, Build, etc.
### Details:
Test model creation, updates, deletions, and basic queries for User, UserKitCollection, Review, ReviewScore, Build, BuildMilestone, BuildComment, UserStore, MarketplaceListing, and existing models (Kit, Upload, etc.). Verify field validation, default values, and basic constraints.

## 3. Create integration tests for complex relationships [pending]
### Dependencies: ["1.2"]
### Description: Test complex multi-model relationships, foreign key constraints, and cascade behaviors
### Details:
Test User->UserKitCollection->Kit relationships, Review->ReviewScore aggregations, Build->BuildMilestone->BuildComment chains, UserStore->MarketplaceListing connections, and Upload->User references. Verify cascade deletes, constraint violations, and relationship integrity.

## 4. Create performance tests for queries [pending]
### Dependencies: ["1.3"]
### Description: Test query performance with indexes, large datasets, and complex filtering operations
### Details:
Create performance benchmarks for common queries like kit searches with filters, user collection lookups, review aggregations, and build listings. Test with sample datasets of varying sizes. Verify that indexes are being used effectively and identify any slow queries that need optimization.
