# Task ID: 1
# Title: Complete Database Schema Implementation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Finalize and optimize the Prisma database schema for all core entities including kits, users, reviews, and relationships
# Details:
The database schema is the foundation of the entire platform. Need to ensure all relationships are properly defined, indexes are optimized, and the schema supports all planned features from the PRD.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for all Prisma models, integration tests for complex relationships, performance tests for queries

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up testing framework and environment [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure Jest, Prisma test database, and testing utilities for database testing
### Details:
Install and configure Jest with TypeScript support, set up separate test database, configure Prisma test client, and create test utilities for database operations.

## 2. Create comprehensive unit tests for all Prisma models [done]
### Dependencies: ["1.1"]
### Description: Write comprehensive unit tests covering CRUD operations, constraints, enums, defaults, and business logic for all models
### Details:
**Model-Level CRUD Tests**: For each model, verify basic create, read, update, delete operations work. Examples: Timeline (create, fetch by slug, update description, delete), Kit (create with grade/series/release type, verify relations), User (create with Clerk ID, ensure uniqueness constraints on email/username). **Constraint Tests**: Check @unique, @@unique, and @@index constraints. Examples: Two Kits cannot have same slug, Two Users cannot have same email/username, Compound unique constraints like KitMobileSuit (kitId, mobileSuitId), ReviewScore (reviewId, category), Business logic constraints like Review (one per user per kit), UserKitCollection (one per user-kit pair). **Enum Validation Tests**: Verify only valid enum values allowed for CollectionStatus (WISHLIST|BACKLOG|BUILT), BuildStatus (PLANNING|IN_PROGRESS|COMPLETED|ON_HOLD), ReviewCategory, MilestoneType, etc. Test that inserting invalid enum values throws errors. **Default Values & Auto Fields**: Ensure defaults and auto-calculated fields work correctly - createdAt auto sets to now(), updatedAt updates on every update, arrays default to [] (scrapedImages, manualLinks), MarketplaceListing currency defaults to "JPY". Test all models: User, UserKitCollection, Review, ReviewScore, Build, BuildMilestone, BuildComment, UserStore, MarketplaceListing, Kit, Upload, Timeline, Series, Grade, ProductLine, MobileSuit, ReleaseType, and all junction tables.

## 3. Create comprehensive integration tests for relationships and constraints [done]
### Dependencies: ["1.2"]
### Description: Test complex multi-model relationships, foreign key constraints, cascade behaviors, and junction table integrity
### Details:
**Relation Integrity Tests**: Prisma enforces referential integrity via @relation. Test that creating a Series with a valid timelineId works, but with an invalid one throws an error. **Cascade/SetNull Behavior Tests**: Prisma lets you configure onDelete. Test these explicitly: Series → Timeline (onDelete: SetNull) - deleting a Timeline should not delete its Series, just null the timelineId; Grade → ProductLine (onDelete: Cascade) - deleting a Grade should delete all its ProductLines; Kit → BaseKit (onDelete: SetNull) - deleting a base kit should not delete variants, just nullify baseKitId. **Junction Table Behavior Tests**: Your schema has multiple M:N junctions: KitMobileSuit, KitUpload, MobileSuitUpload. Test that creating associations works, duplicate association should fail (@@unique), deleting one side of the relation deletes the join row (onDelete: Cascade). **Complex Relationship Chains**: Test User->UserKitCollection->Kit relationships, Review->ReviewScore aggregations, Build->BuildMilestone->BuildComment chains, UserStore->MarketplaceListing connections, and Upload->User references. Verify cascade deletes, constraint violations, and relationship integrity.

## 4. Create comprehensive performance tests and query optimization [done]
### Dependencies: ["1.3"]
### Description: Test query performance with indexes, large datasets, complex filtering operations, and constraint validation performance
### Details:
**Query Performance Tests**: Create performance benchmarks for common queries like kit searches with filters, user collection lookups, review aggregations, and build listings. Test with sample datasets of varying sizes (100, 1000, 10000+ records). **Index Effectiveness Tests**: Verify that indexes are being used effectively for all @unique, @@unique, and @@index constraints. Test query performance on Kit.slug, User.email, User.username, compound indexes like KitMobileSuit (kitId, mobileSuitId), ReviewScore (reviewId, category). **Constraint Performance Tests**: Test that unique constraint validation performs well with large datasets. Verify that foreign key constraint checks don't cause performance bottlenecks. **Complex Relationship Query Performance**: Test performance of queries involving multiple joins (User->UserKitCollection->Kit->Series->Timeline), aggregation queries (Review->ReviewScore averages), and cascade operations. **Optimization Identification**: Identify any slow queries that need optimization and document recommended index additions or query restructuring.
