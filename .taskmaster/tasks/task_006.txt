# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement User Collection Management System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Build wishlist, backlog, and built collection categories with status transitions
# Details:
Create the core collection management system allowing users to organize kits across three categories (wishlist, backlog, built) with seamless status transitions. Ensure that collection controls (add to wishlist/backlog/built) are only visible when the user is signed in.

# Test Strategy:
- Collection CRUD tests
- Status transition tests
- User permission tests (controls hidden when not signed in, visible when signed in)
