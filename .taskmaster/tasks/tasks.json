Examples: Two Kits cannot have same slug, Two Users cannot have same email/username, Compound unique constraints like KitMobileSuit (kitId, mobileSuitId), ReviewScore (reviewId, category), Business logic constraints like Review (one per user per kit), UserKitCollection (one per user-kit pair). **Enum Validation Tests**: Verify only valid enum values allowed for CollectionStatus (WISHLIST|BACKLOG|BUILT), BuildStatus (PLANNING|IN_PROGRESS|COMPLETED|ON_HOLD), ReviewCategory, MilestoneType, etc. Test that inserting invalid enum values throws errors. **Default Values & Auto Fields**: Ensure defaults and auto-calculated fields work correctly - createdAt auto sets to now(), updatedAt updates on every update, arrays default to [] (scrapedImages, manualLinks), MarketplaceListing currency defaults to \"JPY\".

Test that creating associations works, duplicate association should fail (@@unique), deleting one side of the relation deletes the join row (onDelete: Cascade). **Complex Relationship Chains**: Test User->UserKitCollection->Kit relationships, Review->ReviewScore aggregations, Build->BuildMilestone->BuildComment chains, UserStore->MarketplaceListing connections, and Upload->User references.
