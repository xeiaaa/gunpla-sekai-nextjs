# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Authentication System with Clerk
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up Clerk authentication integration with user profiles, session management, and webhook synchronization
# Details:
Implement complete user authentication flow including sign-up, sign-in, profile management, and session handling. Integrate Clerk webhooks (user.created, user.updated, user.deleted) to keep the Prisma User table in sync with Clerk's user records. This ensures your app database always reflects Clerk's authentication state. Handle user.created, user.updated, and user.deleted events to keep our database synchronized with Clerk user data including clerkId, email, username, profileImageUrl, firstName, lastName, etc. Include proper error handling and logging for webhook failures.

# Test Strategy:
Authentication flow tests (sign-up, sign-in, sign-out), session management tests, user profile CRUD tests (via Prisma + Clerk sync), webhook event tests (user created, updated, deleted â†’ Prisma updated accordingly)
